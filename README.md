"# Spotify_Data_Analysis" 

 I did a comprehensive quantitative analysis of playlists (from two distinct people) from Spotify using data processing and advanced statistical analyses, the project aimed to uncover insights into the diversity of their musical preferences, classify song genres, and understand the distribution of prominent features.

Employing various statistical techniques, including ANOVA, and correlation analysis, I quantified the variance within the playlists. Clustering analysis was also performed using Python to identify distinct musical preference patterns.
