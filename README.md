# Melodic Insights: Analyzing My Brother's and My Spotify Data

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Spotify playlists from two distinct individuals me and my brother :). Over two weeks, I independently utilized Python and SQL to process data and perform advanced statistical analyses. The objective was to uncover insights into the diversity of their musical preferences, classify song genres, and understand the distribution of prominent features.

## Objectives
**Diversity Analysis**: Measure and compare the diversity within and between the two playlists.

**Genre Classification**: Classify songs into various genres to understand the genre distribution.

**Feature Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of key features (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability, valence).

### Methods

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Extracted playlist data using Spotify's API.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python and SQL.

2. **Statistical Techniques**:
   - **ANOVA**: Quantified the variance within and between the playlists.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Identified relationships between various musical features.

3. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - Performed clustering analysis using Python to identify distinct musical preference patterns.

### Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: For data processing, statistical analysis, and clustering.
- **SQL**: For efficient data extraction and manipulation.
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### Results

- **Diversity Insights**: Detailed insights into the diversity of musical preferences.
- **Genre Classification**: Visualized genre distribution across the playlists.
- **Feature Analysis**: Illustrated the distribution of prominent features and their correlations.

### Conclusion
This analysis provides a detailed understanding of musical preferences and patterns using statistical and clustering techniques. The insights gained can be useful for music recommendation systems, personalized playlists, and further music-related research.
